# Sentence Construction Tool

## Overview

The **Sentence Construction Tool** is an interactive web application built with **React** and **TypeScript** that helps users practice sentence construction. The app displays incomplete sentences and provides users with word options to fill in the blanks. The goal is to enhance users' sentence-building skills by allowing them to complete sentences correctly.

---

## Features

1. **Sentence Display**: 
   - The app shows incomplete sentences with missing words where users need to fill in the blanks.

2. **Word Options**: 
   - Users are given four word options to fill in the blanks.

3. **Unselect Word**: 
   - Users can unselect a word by clicking on a filled blank to change their selection.

4. **Timer**: 
   - Each question has a **30-second timer**. When the timer ends, the application auto-navigates to the next question.

5. **Next Button**: 
   - The "Next" button becomes active only when all blanks in the current sentence are filled.

6. **Feedback Screen**: 
   - After completing the quiz, users are presented with:
     - A summary of correct and incorrect answers.
     - The correct answers for any incorrect responses.
     - The user's score out of 10.

7. **State Management**: 
   - The app uses React state management to handle the flow of questions and user input.

8. **Data Fetching**: 
   - The application fetches question data from a provided JSON API using **JSON Server** to simulate a backend.

## Technical Stack

1. **Frontend**: React with **TypeScript** (Vite + React Template)
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
3. **State Management**: React state hooks
4. **Backend Simulation**: JSON Server
5. **Deployment**: 
   - Frontend deployed on **Netlify**.
   - Backend (JSON Server) deployed on **Render**.

## Installation & Setup

To set up and run the Sentence Construction Tool locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srinumaragada/sentence-construction-tool.git
cd sentence-construction-tool
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run JSON Server locally

To serve the question data, start JSON Server:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

This will serve the data from `db.json` on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

### 1. JSON Server Deployment (Backend)

To deploy the JSON server, you can use **Render**.

#### Steps to deploy JSON Server on Render:

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Create a new Web Service and select the **GitHub** repository option.
3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository.
4. In the **Build Command**, use:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. In the **Start Command**, use:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 10000
   ```
6. Deploy and your JSON server will be accessible at a URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`).

---

### 2. Frontend Deployment (React + TypeScript)

To deploy the frontend, you can use **Netlify**.

#### Steps to deploy the React app on Netlify:

1. Push your code to **GitHub** (if not already done).
2. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3. Select **New Site from Git**.
4. Connect your GitHub account, and select your repository.
5. Choose the **build command** as:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. Choose the **publish directory** as:
   ```bash
   dist
   ```
7. Deploy the site, and your React app will be live at a URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`).

---

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues during development or deployment:

1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Check that all dependencies have been installed correctly.
2. **Check JSON Server**: Verify that JSON Server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or your deployed Render URL.
3. **Environmental Variables**: If you have any environment-specific configurations, make sure they're correctly set up in your `.env` file.
4. **JSON Server Error**: If you face issues with the JSON Server on Render, ensure that the `db.json` file is correctly uploaded to the repository and is accessible.
